### Good Times
The summer of my first year studying interaction design was a summer of firsts: first internship, first industry job, and not to mention the first time working with a whole suit of programs and tools in the UI Engineering team at Allstate. <!--more--> 12 weeks of particle colliders, SVG madness, and wrestling with React equipped me for not just the next year of university but work in the industry. All in all, a brilliant experience an opportunity to level up not just practical design and coding skills but also learn the process behind taking a product from concept to execution and all the entails.

As a first year interaction design student entering a 12 week internship at Allstate NI without the faintest idea what they were getting themselves into, I chronicled the highs, lows, and epic fails to help others in a similar situation.
